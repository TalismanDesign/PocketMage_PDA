## [Project Summary]

  This project is a PDA powered by an ESP32-S3 running a custom OS written in C++ using PlatformIO. This project utilizes an E-Ink and OLED screen in tandem to mitigate the refresh rate restrictions of an E-Ink panel while retaining the aesthetics and benefits of using E-Ink. This project is a work in progress and currently amounts to a simple GUI for navigating between apps, a text (.txt) file editor, and a basic file manager. More applications are planned for the future and a list of TO-DOs can be found below.

  At this point, the plan for this project is to get the software and hardware to maturity and once a finished product is achieved, a few things will happen. First, the project files (Code, KiCad schematics, 3D files) will be open-sourced and free for anyone to access. Next, I will likely begin selling kits that allow people to purchase all the parts required to build a device for themselves if they don't want to source the parts themselves. Finally, the community will be encouraged to help develop the software for the device and hopefully push it even further than I could myself.

  I will try my best to keep this GitHub up to date with the development of the device.

## [Getting Started]

Start with the docs site:

- [PocketMage Docs](https://talismandesign.github.io/PocketMage_PDA/docs/)
- [Build Environments](https://talismandesign.github.io/PocketMage_PDA/docs/development/build-environments)
- [Command Manual](https://talismandesign.github.io/PocketMage_PDA/docs/command-manual)
- [FAQ](https://talismandesign.github.io/PocketMage_PDA/docs/faq)
- [Scripting](https://talismandesign.github.io/PocketMage_PDA/docs/scripting)
- [App API Reference](https://talismandesign.github.io/PocketMage_PDA/docs/reference/app-api)

To build or extend apps, start with [APP_TEMPLATE.cpp](./Code/PocketMageOS/src/APP_TEMPLATE.cpp) and the [App API Reference](https://talismandesign.github.io/PocketMage_PDA/docs/reference/app-api).
The app walkthrough video is still useful for a first pass:
